# Lead-scoring-case-study
Problem Statement
X Education needs a lead scoring model to identify high-potential leads, improve sales efficiency.
CEO's Expectation: The CEO has set a target of 80% conversion rate, emphasizing the importance of this project.
Need for Lead Prioritization: The company needs a system to identify and prioritize "hot leads" – those most likely to convert – to improve sales efficiency.
Lead Conversion Rate: X Education faces a challenge with a low lead conversion rate of approximately 30%, despite generating a significant number of leads.
Inefficient Sales Process: The current sales process involves contacting all leads, resulting in wasted effort and resources on less promising prospects

# Goals of the Case Study:
1, Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.

2, There are some more problems presented by the company which your model should be able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future so you will need to handle these as well. These problems are provided in a separate doc file. Please fill it based on the logistic regression model you got in the first step. Also, make sure you include this in your final PPT where you'll make recommendations.
